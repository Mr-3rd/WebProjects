    <p>I'm a Video Buff. I grew up without TV, unless you count SnowBlown PBS on Rabbit Ears! <br>
    These days I watch EVERYTHING! If I had to pick a favorite: <br>
    I've watched the Disney <i>Cars</i> movie exactly 28 times. <br>
    Lightening McQueen is a hotshot racer oblivious to how poorly he treats the world around him. <br>
    A pewter blue Porsche 911 (996 body style) teaches him that life in the fast lane
      isn't all it's made out to be!<br>
